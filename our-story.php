					<h2>A Different Approach</h2>
					<p class="mb20">Traditional classified ads are boring – with little attention to design and innovation, they lack the fundamental integration between current day technology and simply helping people look for a job, find an apartment, buy an antique vase, or communicate with their community like they’ve always wanted. </p>
					<p>In short: Sayist allows you to have the most fulfilling experience possible for classifieds. You’ve posted, snapped, shared, tweeted, and we’ve listened.  With intuitive design, the incorporation of video, and real-time share-ability across different social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, Sayist allows you to experience a whole new dimension of classified ads like never before.</p>
